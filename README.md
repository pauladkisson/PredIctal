# PredIctal: An Automated Seizure Prediction Algorithm
Predicting Seizure onset from multichannel EEG Data using CNNs trained on Time-Frequency Representations

## Data
Data was sourced from the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge hosted on Kaggle, for more detailed information see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/seizure-prediction/overview).  In brief, the dataset consisted of many 10-minute multichannel intracranial EEG recordings from 2 differnt human patients and 5 different dogs.  Each 10-minute 'segment' was labeled 'preictal' if it preceded a seizure event or 'interictal' if it did not.
